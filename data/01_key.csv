"Know-Your-Customer (KYC) policies of CCE’s don’t bother me, I feel my identity is secure."
I worry about harmful government regulation that CCE’s may be subject to in the future.
"The ethics of CCE’s concern me like faking trade volume, insider trading, and price manipulation."
I dislike that CCE’s can change platform policies at will without input from the community of users.
Centralization concerns me from the perspective of infrastructure risk like network downtimes.
It bothers me that I don’t have full control of my assets (i.e. no private key).
"As a central repository of assets, CCE’s are a prime target for thieves and hackers."
Immediately after purchasing I transfer my assets to cold storage anyways.
I trust CCE’s to properly custody my assets with the highest security and privacy procedures.
I’m okay leaving my assets in the CCE hot wallets.
I do not understand how transaction fees are calculated.
I never run into issues with daily purchase limits.
I don’t have access to all the crypto assets I want to buy.
CCE’s fees are reasonable - I’m willing to pay for the convenience.
I’d like to place larger orders.
My daily deposit limit is too small.
My daily withdrawal limit is too small.
I had trouble transferring funds into my CCE wallet.
"The bank wire process was cumbersome, I had to get in contact with my bank."
"I do not understand the different between debit, ACH, and bank wire transfers."
I do not earn interest on my assets like I do in my traditional savings account.
I never need to transfer my assets to DeFi wallets.
"It bothers me that I am unable to lend, borrow or collateralize my assets from my CCE wallet."
I wish there was built-in functionality with DeFi protocols and other dApps.
I don’t need smart contract functionality with the assets in my CCE wallet.
